# Image-Compression-over-MNIST
 Image compression comes
under data compression in which the size and storage
sufficiency of digital images are reduced. In this project we are
using convolutional auto encoders for data compression. Here is
a basic idea about autoencoder, ‘Autoencoding’ is a data
compression algorithm where the compression and
decompression functions are given as follows 1.) Data – specific;
2.) Lossy; 3.) Learning automatically from examples rather
than engineered by a human; As we are giving the inputs as
images, the autoencoders applied on images are always
convolutional autoencoders. After the compression of the image
to 128- dimensional dense vector, the original image has to be
restored. For the sake of undoing the defects, which degrade an
image, we recreate the original image.
